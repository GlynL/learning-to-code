# How I Learnt to Code & Got My First Job

My coding journey began about two and a half years ago and I started working my first full-time developer job this month (wooo!). This might seem like a long time for some of you but I didn't rush it and wasn't trying to find work until two months ago. Many people have done it quicker and I was probably ready for a while. I've decided to share my story, my resources and what worked for me when learning web development.

## How I got interested in coding
I was living in Thailand, training and fighting Muay Thai while working about 10 hours a week as a social media manager. I wasn't really enjoying marketing as a career and I wasn't as flexible as I wished due to needing to be active at certain hours of the day. Luckily I had the time to learn something new. I'd looked at a few things online which sounded like good skills to have that were flexible and able to be done remotely but it wasn't until I met a guy travelling Vietnam, who was working as a web developer, that I was intrigued and started to play around a little bit with coding.

## Where to learn?
At first, I was jumping around trying out different sites such as Codeacademy, freeCodeCamp and others I can't recall. I never really got anywhere with these to start with but they got me interested. After researching, I decided to take CS50 - Introduction To Computer Science, a famous Harvard course run by David Malan which teaches the real basics of computer science such as data structures, algorithms and the relevant workings of a computer. This is all done in C but the basics you learn and confidence you build carry to every language.

Once I completed CS50 I started on freeCodeCamp. What I loved about freeCodeCamp most was the projects which give you great ideas to practice and test your skills as you are learning. Once I got through the first couple of sections on HTML/CSS/JavaScript and onto more advanced topics I didn't find the lessons thorough enough and ditched them for Udemy courses which went in depth on a topic and then I could go back and build the projects in freeCodeCamp for practice.

I used this combination of Udemy and freeCodeCamp until I had a solid grasp of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Redux. I also completed all of the projects on freeCodeCamp except for the data visualisation section using D3.js, as I didn't find this skill sought after when looking at jobs.

## What next?
Once I was confident in these skills I still hadn't gotten involved in open source except for a couple of tiny pull requests. I simply didn't know where to get started and every time I looked at issues I couldn't see anything interesting or those that were, someone had already claimed. Eventually I got involved with freeCodeCamp as a contributor and would recommend just making a habit of checking the issues once a week or so and see if there's something that you want to help with. 

Along with open source, I also got an internship as a front-end developer, using React. It wasn't the ideal internship but it was remote and I learnt a lot by working on a codebase someone else had built. I was also working on the front-end alone which presented it's own challenges of being given a problem and having to research and solve it. In this time, I learnt about and implemented internationalisation as well as React Native.

## Getting the Job
This was mostly a game of patience. All up it took me 2 months of searching and applying every day to jobs. Most of the time I didn't hear back and I applied for a lot of jobs which were looking for mid level developers or more experience than I had which didn't work out. Most of the jobs I found on job boards were advertised by recruiters and I found these the most successful. I often received a call and meeting with recruiters who were impressed by my resume and skills and were looking for junior roles for me. I was also attending meetups to network and look for jobs. I didn't find any roles directly through this as noone was looking for juniors but I did end up meeting a recruiter at a React meetup who I grabbed coffee. He had a role where they were open to juniors and this is where I ended up accepting a position.

The process for this position was a tech test LINK, and then an interview where I was actually offered the job at the conclusion of. It's a great small company where I'm working with the senior developer and can bounce ideas and get help when I need it. I get to use React daily and will get the chance to work with a lot of technologies as projects require them.

When I was interviewing the thing that people appreciated most was the fact I had worked on a real application in an internship. Even if I could have done everything in a personal project it proved that I could work on a real world application with other people. I would certainly recommend seeking out internships as this on your resume will look great and be a talking point during interviews.

## What would I do differently?
If I were to do it all over again, there's a couple of things I would do differently. For starters, I would get more involved with open source projects and much earlier on. There's always something you can contribute to a project even if you are still learning HTML and CSS. You may have to be more particular about the issues you pick up but you can definitely help! The skills you gain in navigating a large codebase, working with others are invaluable and as you learn more you can pick more complex issues to match your skills.
